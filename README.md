## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I used MutationObserver: observe() method in this project. Was something new for me but I'm pretty sure i got it.
Created simple drag and drop functionality. When i implemented it, it had performance issues. After few thoughts I fixed this problem.
Tried out theme changing button. Made it with help of MutationObserver just as in drag and drop case. Also used local storage for storing user's theme so it didn't reset on page reload.

### Continued development

- Definitely have to work on perfecting responsive web design.

- Should make my code more clean. 

- Work on comments.


### Useful resources

- [YouTube video about drag and drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfYWwQrtzzY&t=618s) - Based on this video i implemented my simple drag and drop feature.
